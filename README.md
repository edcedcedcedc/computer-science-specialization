This is the final project for the Game Development specialization of Open Education in Computer Science at [Open Source Society University](https://github.com/edcedcedcedc/computer-science).



## Topics covered

Character creation and movement
Input for PC and console controllers
Extensive use of Animation Blueprints (and Anim Instances, their C++ parents)
1D and 2D Blendspaces
Strafing
Turn-in-place
Aim Offsets
Inverse Kinematics
Animation Curves
Character lean when running
Crouching (with dynamic capsule resizing)
Turn hips while running
Weapon fire with recoil animations
Reloading
Weapon blast and impact particles
Weapon beam particles (smoke trails)
Bullet shell eject particles
Sound effects
Blending animations per bone, by bool, and by enum - play one animation with one part of the body (running or crouching) while simultaneously playing another animation with another part of the body (reload, aim, or weapon fire)
Attach and equip different weapons (pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles)
Automatic and semi-automatic gunfire
Move different gun parts (the clip/magazine, and pistol slide) during animations
Camera zoom while aiming
Dynamic crosshairs that spread in reaction to:
Character speed
Weapon fire
Aiming
Jumping
Different crosshairs per weapon
Widget components, showing:
Item names
Item types
Ammo counts
Item rarity
HUD animations
Full item inventory system
Data tables, in Blueprints and C++
Curves to control:
Item movement during pickup
Color and brightness pulse for material effects
Material creation, including:
Post-process materials
Dynamic material instances
Setting material properties from C++
Driving material properties with curves
Material functions
Blending materials together
Outline effects
Glow/pulse effects
Retargeting animations
Retargeting whole Animation Blueprints
Numerous gameplay algorithms
Use of data structures, including:
structs
enums
arrays
maps
and more
Animation montages
Anim Notifies for sounds, weapon trails, and custom notifies
Sync markers for footsteps and sync groups
The course comes with a huge amount of assets, including:
Sounds
Textures
Particle effects
Meshes
Delegates
Interfaces
Dynamic footsteps that spawn different sounds and particle systems depending on the surface type
Physical materials and surface types
Niagra particle systems
Line traces
Enemy AI
Behavior Trees and Blackboard Components
Multiple enemy types with varying levels of Health, Damage, Size and Movement Speed
Headshot damage, with:
Higher damage for headshots
Number widgets that pop up and animate with bullet hits
Different colored numbers for headshots
Character and enemy health bars
Enemy patrol, agro, chase and attack player
Death mechanics
Stun mechanics
Melee attacks with melee weapon trails
Explosives that cause damage and death
Level prototyping
Creating full levels based on our prototypes using professional assets
Light baking
Post-process effects
